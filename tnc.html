      out in state-of-the-art technology, the User shall take precautions with regards to the backing up of data.
      <br>
      <br>
      8.3 The User shall use the Secondary market and the range of information offer provided therein, solely for the
      designated purpose of acquiring information and/or initiating and concluding Sale and purchase agreements.
      <br>
      <br>
      8.4 The User shall make no such contents accessible with or through the Secondary market, as are in breach of
      statutory regulations, particularly provisions of the criminal or competition law or infringes on third-party
      rights, including copyrights, industrial property rights (e.g. trademark or other labeling rights) or personality
      rights. The same shall apply to offensive contents.
      <br>
      <br>
      8.5 The User undertakes not to impede the smooth operation of the Secondary market and particularly, not to
      undertake, mandate or tolerate any action that may disrupt the designated function of the Secondary market and/or
      the designated access of other Users to the Secondary market.
      <br>
      <br>
      8.6 Users are obligated to prevent criminally-motivated transactions and contribute to uncovering and fighting
      them. This relates particularly, to transactions serving the purpose of money laundering or financing terrorism as
      well as other punishable actions that may constitute hazards to the property of a User or Debitos. Sellers and
      Buyers are particularly obligated to comply with statutory provisions on combating money laundering in accordance
      with the law on the tracing of profits realized through serious criminal offenses (Money Laundering Act – GwG).
      This shall include the transmission of information to the other respective contract partner for identity
      verification, latest before the conclusion of the Sale and purchase agreement.
      <br>
      <br>
      8.7 Buyers are obligated to inform Debitos immediately before payment of the purchase price about the upcoming
      payment and the respective purchase price.
      <br>
      <br>
      <h3>9. FEE OBLIGATION, FOLLOW-UP PERIOD</h3>
      9.1 Registration on the Secondary market shall be free of charge.
      <br>
      <br>
      9.2 Participation in an Auction and the utilization of Special services shall be subject to the payment of Fees.
      The Seller bears the Listing fee. The Seller shall pay the Consignment fee unless it is otherwise stated in the
      Sales offer that the Buyer shall pay such Consignment fee. The costs of Special services shall be taken from the
      price list unless otherwise agreed in text form.
      <br>
      <br>
      9.3 All Fees are net Fees. VAT only applies if these are the statutory.
      <br>
      <br>
      9.4 The User shall be able to set-off accounts against Debitos only if the receivables are not disputed or have
      been legally ascertained. The User shall be able to base withholding right only on such receivables as are due to
      it from Debitos by virtue of the respective agreement.
      <br>
      <br>
      9.5 Remuneration shall be made even if the User sells a consigned receivable to a User that is registered in
      Debitos within one year (follow-up period) of the revocation of a sales-offer (item 13 below). In such case, the
      User will be obligated to inform Debitos of such successful sale within the follow-up period.
      <br>
      <br>
      <h3>10. SUBSCRIPTION FEE</h3>
      10.1 In addition to the free services Debitos offers further Subscription plans with costs. An overview of the
      Subscription plans and the benefits and costs associated with them can be viewed on the website.
      <br>
      <br>
      10.2 The Subscription plans have a fixed term and are automatically renewed for the same period of time unless the
      User has cancelled the Subscription plan four weeks before the end of the term.
      <br>
      <br>
      10.3 The fees for the Subscription plans are due in advance, but no later than on the first day of the
      Subscription period for the entire Subscription period.
      <br>
      <br>
      <h3>11. CHARGING OF FEES, TERMS OF PAYMENT, ADVANCED PAYMENT</h3>
      11.1 The Listing fee is earned and due with each start of an Auction on the Secondary market by Debitos. This also
      applies to a possible repeated Auction or a possible Indicative phase. The Listing fee is in particular
      independent of a successful acceptance of a bid. The respective Listing fee can be viewed on the website.
      <br>
      <br>
      11.2 Consignment fees will be charged with the acceptance of a bid in an Auction or with any other bilateral
      transaction agreement between Seller and Buyer. In addition to sentence 1, the Consignment fee will also be
      charged if:
      <br>
      <br>
      (a) the Consignment fee is to be paid by the Seller if
<br>
<br>
      (i) the Seller has revoked its Sales offer in accordance with item 13.2 below and if the Buyer is able to demand
      the refund of his expenses from the Seller in the cases of item 13.3 below; or
<br>
      (ii) the Buyer waives the conclusion of the Sale and purchase agreement in the case of item 17.3;
<br>
      (b) if the Seller waives the conclusion of the Sale and purchase agreement in the cases of item 17.4 below the
      Consignment fee has to be paid by the Buyer.
      <br>
      <br>
      11.3 The Consignment fee is earned in full from Debitos after the acceptance of a bid and is therefore legally
      independent, detached and unrelated to the actual conclusion of a Sale and purchase agreement between buyer and
      seller. In particular, the Consignment fee is also payable if the buyer and seller – for whatever reason – do not
      conclude a Sale and purchase agreement for the financial product after the acceptance of the bid.
      <br>
      <br>
      11.4 Other Fees, which are not Consignment fees, the Listing fees, the Subscription fees, including fees for
      Special services, shall be charged after the service has been rendered.
      <br>
      <br>
      11.5 Fees will be due for payment upon the receipt of an invoice. Invoiced amounts shall be paid into the bank
      account specified on the invoice. They shall be credited not later than the fifteenth day of the receipt of such
      invoice.
      <br>
      <br>
      11.6 Debitos shall refund advanced payments to the User if the fee for which such advanced payment was made has
      not been charged.
      <br>
      <br>
      <h3>12. CONSIGNMENT OF FINANCIAL PRODUCTS</h3>
      12.1 The User, who is the Seller of a Financial product shall consign Financial products to Auction and offer same
      for sale only if it will be in a position to meet the conditions of the Sale and purchase agreement and if it is
      the owner with the right of disposition over such Financial products or a third party has authorized and empowered
      it to dispose of such Financial product. In case of acting for a third party the power of attorney has to be
      shown.
      <br>
      <br>
      12.2 For the duration of this agreement the Seller undertakes not to appoint third parties apart from Debitos with
      advertising, sales promotion, brokerage or similar services relating to the sale of the Financial product.
      <br>
      <br>
      12.3 For the duration of this agreement and another six months after end of auction the Seller undertakes not to
      conduct any direct sales activities of its own without involving Debitos.
      <br>
      <br>
      12.4 During marketing, the Seller shall determine the Duration of Auction within the scope of the minimum and
      maximum limits that are predetermined by Debitos, the type of Auction, the Minimum price, and if the Seller wants
      to place an Indicative phase preliminary to an Auction. In the process, the Seller may decide at its own
      discretion, to extend the Duration of Auction by the respective length of time to be specified by it if the
      Minimum price has not yet been attained. This shall be without prejudice to the authority of Debitos to
      automatically extend the Duration of the Auction in accordance with item 16.3 below.
      <br>
      <br>
      12.5 Financial products may be consigned to Auction with the Buy-Now option. In such case, the Acceptance of bid
      shall be made independent of the Duration of an Auction at a Fixed price and upon the first bid.
      <br>
      <br>
      12.6 In consigning the Financial product to Auction, the Seller shall furnish such information as is required for
      the assessment of the Financial product and for the conclusion and fulfillment of the Sale and purchase agreement
      in a truthful manner or post same in the Data room or both. It shall not knowingly withhold any such information
      from the Buyer in the Sales offer, as may reduce the value of the Financial product. This shall include any such
      information and documents as are requested on the Website in the course of consigning the Financial product to
      Auction.
      <br>
      <br>
      12.7 For the purpose of ensuring data protection, the User shall observe – while furnishing information in
      accordance with item 12.6 above – that it takes care on the local laws regarding data compliance and the General
      Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).
      <br>
      <br>
      <h3>13. REVOCATION OF A SALES OFFER</h3>
      13.1 The Seller undertakes towards Debitos not to revoke the Consignment of a Financial product within the
      Duration of Auction subject to item 13.2 below.
      <br>
      <br>
      13.2 The Seller shall have the right to revoke a Sales offer before the Acceptance of bid if the legal base of the
      Financial product has been lost in part or in whole within the Duration of Auction or if material legal relations
      undergo changes in any other way with respect to the Financial product, and the Seller has informed Debitos of the
      withdrawal of the Financial product in advance.
      <br>
      <br>
      13.3 Should bidding in the Indian Auction have been made at the Minimum price before the revocation, the Seller
      shall – in the event of revocation – furnish the Buyer proof of the reasons that have led to such revocation.
      Should the proof not be furnished, or should the proof be insufficient to justify the revocation of a Sales offer,
      the Seller shall compensate the Buyer the costs of verifying the Financial product at an adequate amount. The
      Buyer shall own direct entitlement towards the Seller by virtue of the obligation of clause 2 (real agreement in
      favor of third parties).
      <br>
      <br>
      13.4 The Seller can revoke a sale offer during and after the Indicative phase. In this case the fee for the
      Indicative phase is due.
      <br>
      <br>
      <h3>14. LEGAL RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN USERS</h3>
      14.1 The Secondary market shall provide, in accordance with the provisions of the Terms and conditions of usage,
      the virtual opportunity for the initiation of a Sale and purchase agreement between the Seller and a Bidder in an
      Auction-type environment with Debitos serving as an agent.
      <br>
      <br>
      14.2 The Sale and purchase agreement shall neither be deemed concluded upon the Acceptance of bid nor by virtue of
      other declarations or actions on the Secondary market. The Sale and purchase agreement shall be deemed exclusively
      concluded between the successful Bidder and the Seller as an after-effect of the Auction. Unless otherwise agreed,
      content and fulfillment as well as the processing of the Sale and purchase agreement shall only involve the
      parties to the Sale and purchase agreement and be deemed done at their own risk and on their own account.
      <br>
      <br>
      14.3 The User agrees to comply on its own responsibility with all the legal provisions that are of relevance to
      the User during the initiation, conclusion and processing of the Sale and purchase agreement, including the
      provisions on distance selling and electronic business operations , data protection as well as local Banking laws
      and the relevant provisions of the fiscal law (e.g. User-relevant disclosure obligations) and all statutory
      User-related and teleservices-related requirements.
      <br>
      <br>
      14.4 Debitos shall render no legal services in connection with the conclusion and processing of a Sale and
      purchase agreement.
      <br>
      <br>
      <h3>15. CONTRACT AND PROCESSING MODEL</h3>
      15.1 The Seller is obligated to submit his Sale and purchase agreement to the Data room before activating the
      Auction.
      <br>
      <br>
      15.2 The successful Bidder agrees to accept the Sale and purchase agreement from the Seller. The Seller shall
      ensure on its own responsibility that the terms and conditions of its own Sale and purchase agreement do justice

      <br>
      <h3>16. EXPIRATION OF AN AUCTION, BIDDING AND CONCLUSION OF AGREEMENT</h3>
      16.1 The Website offers the option of selecting Sales offers through a search function and submitting a bid within
      the period of the Auction. Prices specified in bids may contain incurring turnover taxes in the statutory amount.
      <br>
      <br>
      16.2 A bid shall take effect upon its submission to the Website and its transmission to the Secondary market. In a
      Indian Auction a Bid shall be subject to the deleting condition that a higher bid may be submitted during the
      period of the Auction. In a Sealed Auction a Bid shall be subject to the deleting condition if the Expiration Date
      elapses or the Seller selects another Bid.
      <br>
      <br>
      16.3 Debitos shall have the right to extend the Duration of the Auction at its reasonable discretion for the
      purpose of considering higher bids. Should the extended Duration of Auction expire without the submission of a
      higher bid, the Auction shall be closed. Should in Indian Auction another higher bid be submitted within the
      final three minutes preceding the expiry of the Auction Duration, Debitos shall have the right to automatically
      extend the period by three more minutes. In this case, the Duration of Auction shall be extended automatically.
      <br>
      <br>
      16.4 Within a period of six months of an unsuccessful Auction, a Bidder shall have the opportunity of specifying a
      new price (relisting) for the Financial product through the Secondary market. In such case, the Seller may choose
      to renew the Sales offer and consign the Financial product to Auction once again.
      <br>
      <br>
      16.5 Additionally, the Seller can place an Indicative phase preliminary to a binding phase. In this phase the
      Seller is not obliged to sell. 16.5 Buyers can place non binding Indicative bids. This phase is used for both
      sides for a pricing orientation and convergence.
      <br>
      <br>

      declines using the Adapted Contract Model for the conclusion of the Sale and purchase agreement or demands
      amendments or deviations from the terms and conditions of the Adapted Contract Model or the Highest bid in a
      manner that is in breach of good faith.
      <br>
      <br>
      17.5 Seller and Buyer may refrain from concluding the Sale and purchase agreement if the commencement of business
      relations will be in breach of criminal statutes or fails to meet the standards required for authentication

      guidelines for combating money laundering forbid, in conjunction with local Anti-Money Laundering rules, any form

      impression of User’s reliability and as are made available by such third parties for classification or assessment
      purposes, shall be applied by the User on the Website particularly on the offer pages and profile pages unless
      they are authorized by Debitos.
      <br>
      <br>
      <h3>19. PROHIBITION OF CIRCUMVENTION, CONTRACT PENALTY</h3>
      19.1 No User shall either directly or indirectly circumvent or attempt to circumvent the Secondary market and its
      procedures governing the conclusion of a Sale and purchase agreement in matters affecting the selling or the
      purchase of a Financial product that has been consigned to Auction in order to facilitate the avoidance of the
      payment of a fee that is due to Debitos.

      <br>
      19.2 In accordance with item 19.1 above, Seller is particularly obligated to refrain from making the following

      Secondary market.
<br>
      (b) Sales offers that seek to achieve in any other way, the goal of selling or purchasing a Financial product that
      has been consigned to Auction, outside or by bypassing the Secondary market.
<br>
      (c) Such Sales offer as design the on-screen information regarding the Financial product on the offer pages of the
      Secondary market in such a way that the contact information of the Seller (e.g. email address, web address,

      other form.
      <br>
      (d) Sales offers in which the Highest bid or Fixed price is not the final price for the purchase of a Financial
      product. This includes Sales offers in which payment by installment is permitted (e.g. leasing or hire financing)
      and the final price displayed is only one or several installments of the overall price of a Financial product.
      <br>
      (e) Sales offers that fail to assign Financial products to the appropriate category of the Secondary market to
      circumvent the payment of Fees in the appropriate category.

      Financial product specified in the sales offer.

      far as feasible at reasonably expectable expenditure within the scope of existing technical possibilities. Should
      the Duration of an Auction come to an end during an unforeseeable failure of the Secondary market, Debitos shall
      extend the period adequately at its own reasonable discretion unless the Seller informs Debitos that it does not
      require any extension. Debitos shall refund Fees that have already been paid for offers that could not be posted

      of such work by posting messages on the Secondary market, taking the rightful interests of Users into due
      consideration during the execution of such work. The Duration of Auction will not be extended as a result of

      21.2 In other cases, Debitos’s liability only applies to a breach of a contractual obligation the fulfillment of
      which is a material prerequisite for the execution of the agreement and on whose fulfillment the User may
      generally rely (cardinal obligation); such liability shall be limited to the compensation of foreseeable and

      and exclusions regulated in this item 21.
      <br>
